This archive holds the complete sources needed to build
BeShare 3.02, including the MUSCLE 3.20 library sources.
The latter have been slightly tweaked for Haiku's needs,
but are still compatible with BeOS.

In the 'source' directory, "Makefile" is for Haiku,
with the old PPC etc. stuff removed; "Makefile BeOS"
is essentially the original 2.28 version with one
added source file.  If you're working in BeOS, it's
probably best to rename them.

To build (after renaming the Makefile if you're in BeOS),
simply cd to the 'source' directory, and type "make".

-- older instructions from BeOS times --

In order to recompile BeShare, do the following:

1. Make sure you have the BeOS developers tools 
   (gcc or mwcc) installed on your machine.
2. Download MUSCLE 3.20 or higher from 
      http://www.lcscanada.com/muscle/index.html,
   and unpack it so that the "muscle" directory is present in the
   directory above this one.
3. While in this directory, run "make".  After a minute or two, a fresh 
   BeShare executable named either BeShare.x86 or BeShare.ppc should be ready.
