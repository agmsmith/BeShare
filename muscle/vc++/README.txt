In this directory you will find Visual C++ 6 project files created 
by yours truly (Vitaliy :) ). 

To compile muscle, do the following:

1. Open the "muscle.dsw" project file in VC++

2. Click Build->Batch Build

3. Make sure everything in the list is checked. Click Build.

4. Sit back and relax. If you have a slow computer (less then a dual 800), go take an hour long
	lunch break :P. Otherwise, muscle builds in just a minute. 

5. Open the new "Build" folder that is created. You now have three files: admin.exe, muscled.exe,
	and muscle.lib. You can run your server with muscled.exe, and maintain it with admin.exe.
	You can build your own apps and link against muscle.lib.
