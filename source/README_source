This archive holds the complete sources needed to build
BeShare 3.00, including the MUSCLE 3.20 library sources.
The latter have been slightly tweaked for Haiku's needs,
but are still compatible with BeOS.

In the 'source' directory, "Makefile" is for Haiku,
with the old PPC etc. stuff removed; "Makefile BeOS"
is essentially the original 2.28 version with one
added source file.  If you're working in BeOS, it's
probably best to rename them.

To build (after renaming the Makefile if you're in BeOS),
simply cd to the 'source' directory, and type "make".
