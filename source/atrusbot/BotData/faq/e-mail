Q: 
How to add more e-mail addressed to the BOT's list?

A:
Use StyledEdit to make plain textfile than contains the mailto: tag. Filename must be in
lowercase and saved as the nick you want that e-mail address associated with. Place the file in the email folder found within the bin folder inside the BOTs working directory.
