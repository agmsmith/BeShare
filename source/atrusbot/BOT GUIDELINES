1.  Your bot should not post any public chat messages, 
    except when it has been spoken to publically, by name, 
    by a human.  (that is, when a human has posted a public chat text 
    that starts with your bot's name, e.g. "TimeBot what time is it?"). 
    At that time, your bot may repond with a short line of public text. 
 
2.  Your bot should identify itself as a BeShare bot by placing 
    a boolean field named "bot" into its beshare/name MUSCLE node, 
    with a value of true.   (If you are using void's BeShare::Bot (Bot.cpp) class, 
    don't worry, as this is done for you by that code).  This allows 
    other users and bots to identify you as a bot, and act accordingly. 
 
3.  Any messages that your bot receives from other bots should not 
    be responded to.  This will ensure that bots do not get into 
    infinite reply->reply->reply->reply->.... cycles.  (Again, if you 
    are using void's code, this logic will be handled for you). 
 
3.  When someone /msg's your bot, please reply with a private 
    message, not a public one. 
 
4.  Please implement a feature in your bot so that when someone 
    says "<BotName> owner", your bot responds with your username 
    and email address.  This will allow people to contact you 
    if your Bot is getting out of hand.  E.g. 
 
       Jeremy:  TimeBot owner 
       TimeBot: My owner is Jeremy, a.k.a mailto:jaf@lcsaudio.com 
 
These guidelines are posted in order to keep BeShare chat 
enjoyable for everyone.  Please abide by them when creating 
and deploying your bot.  If bots are abused on BeShare, Minox 
and I will have to look into banning IP addresses, and I really
don't want to have to do that. 
 
Thanks,
