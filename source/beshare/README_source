This archive holds the complete sources needed to build
BeShare 3.03, including the MUSCLE 3.20 library sources.
The latter have been slightly tweaked for Haiku's needs,
but are still compatible with BeOS.

To build, simply cd to the 'source/beshare' directory, and type "make".
You can also do "make debug" and "make clean".
Works for PowerPC 32 bit CPUs, Intel 32 bit and 64 bit, BeOS and Haiku OS.
